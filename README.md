# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake_ptr-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In This project I have decided to extend this Snake game, following the principles I have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that I can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features. Some feature that I have added are as follows:

* Use of SmartPointers
* With SOLID principles in mind, the classes have been Split.
* Every class, struct does one thing only as much as possible.
*  When the body is updated there has been a Generic queue added.
* Added a queue for adding and removing points from the body of the snake.
* Removed SDL stuff from the classes and replaced it with a new one, Snake_Point, known only by the game and 
not by the SDL.
* Added a new class Board that is basically the board where we play the snake. It knows the width and the height.
* Added a new struct called Snake_Cell which basically is a cell on the board.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  * Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source.
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
